Whatever was the project for the 2025.1 Brackeys game jam. The theme was:
Nothing Can Go Wrong

You started with the incomplete menus from Blood Rocket and actually gave them 
some functionality.

When you started this project we you working towards making a story about a captain
of a sandship that has a number of misfortunate events happen to him.

When you had some basic, but not perfect, functionality and started the art, it 
became apparent that it was going to take too much time to make all those assets
in the remaining time.

You decided to pivot and make a stupid story using the placeholder assets you had
and some quickly scribbled line drawings.

The story was about a future where all the people are a clone of a single person.

You started working on that but wasted a lot of time, in terms of making this game,
rewriting the code that should have been ignored. Thing were kind of messy at that
point.

In the process of that, you actually made a basic functional menu system but no real game.

Now you have the basic elements of a menu driven game in this package. It's still missing
a lot of stuff though.

You were in the process of setting up:
	the inventory system that collects item quantities
	the character system to use a dictionary to create the status attributes
	the command system to have a single function per command
	the interactive system to act as a base for all interactive objects
	
Things that this project needs:
	A better encounter loop that allows the turn of the characters to be based
	upon attributes -- right now the encounter loop is a chain connected to the 
	story window and enemy signals
	
	More interactives like shops n stuff

But this package should give you a better headstart on the next gamejam.

Some of this stuff is also going to be useful for Dobble Trobble.
